test 1 (Normal case):  
	Entering 200, 400 ,600 km into the control distance km input will receive
 	open_time and close_time as the outputs for each distance.
	Once the submit button is selected the webpage is cleared for new entries and km, 
	miles, start date, start time, open time and close time are sent to the database.
	This can be verified in the Javascript Console. Once the display button is clicked
	a new tab will open with a table of all logged open and close times.


test 2 (Edge case): 
	If 0 entries are input for the control distances and the display button is 
	selected an error page (none.html) will load; prompting the user to enter a 
	distance. The webpage will contain a link back to the home page.
	The same functionality is invoked when the submit button is selected and
	there are 0 entries.
